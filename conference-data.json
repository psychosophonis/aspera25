So while I have an individual commitment to the iterative cycle of research and creative work that Hazel Smith and I promoted in a our book on practice-led research and research-led practice, this is not by any means solely applied to sound production. For example, the MAXMSPJitter platform allows integrated sound and image creation, and the concept of algorithmic synaesthesia that appeals particularly to me. I will focus on these interactions, as well as the need for all creative practitioners to bring political and intellectual pressure to bear on our current constrictions. "

          "abstract": "Recent regulatory changes have intensified standardisation pressures across Australian higher education. The Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) 2021 streamlined provider categories and strengthened TEQSA's oversight of research degree quality assurance. These changes create particular tensions for screen production research, where standardised assessment frameworks must accommodate the inherently experimental nature of creative practice methodologies.\nMembers of the ASPERA research sub-committee have conducted an initial landscape analysis of HDR examination structures across Australian and New Zealand institutions, examining assessment criteria, examiner guidelines, and degree-level expectations from Honours through to PhD. This analysis reveals both challenges and opportunities as universities navigate regulatory compliance while supporting creative experimentation.\nThe evidence suggests several areas requiring attention. For example, beneficial flexibility exists in creative versus written component weightings (ranging from 50/50 to 80/20) and word length requirements, with some institutions positioning the creative work and the written thesis document as equal partners while others treat the creative work as primary. This diversity reflects appropriate methodological flexibility but requires clearer communication of assessment expectations and requirements to more effectively support students and examiners.\nAssessment criteria frequently default to traditional humanities frameworks emphasising ‘substantial original contribution to knowledge’ without adequately accounting for how creative practice generates and embodies knowledge differently. Many examiner guidelines struggle to articulate what ‘international standing’ means for examiner selection in creative practice fields, or how to assess ‘professional standard’ in creative work alongside academic rigour.\nHowever, our analysis also reveals promising innovations where institutions have developed sophisticated frameworks that genuinely embrace creative practice methodologies while maintaining rigorous standards. These approaches recognise creative work as contributing methodology, analysis, and outcome—not merely acting as illustration of written research.\nTo start this roundtable, we will present our landscape analysis, highlighting both challenges and innovative solutions. We will then engage participants as active contributors to our ongoing research through structured discussion and data collection (with appropriate ethics approval). We invite current and former HDR students, supervisors and examiners to share experiences through this recorded group discussion and to register interest for follow-up individual interviews.\nKey questions for exploration include: How can institutions balance regulatory compliance with methodological flexibility? What constitutes appropriate assessment criteria for creative practice screen production research? How might we better prepare examiners and upskill students/supervisors to navigate standards frameworks effectively?\nThis participatory approach extends impact beyond the conference session. Participants will contribute directly to building an evidence base informing policy recommendations and advocacy strategies, culminating in a comprehensive sector report for the ASPERA community (late 2026).\nThis discussion directly addresses ASPERA's \"Experiments in Screen\" theme by examining how institutional structures can enable experimental approaches within regulatory frameworks, preserving space for genuine creative innovation while meeting legitimate quality requirements.",

          "abstract": "LEAN IN sits within Coleman’s body of work interrogating modern Australian women navigating the complex terrains of work, sex, and society. Eschewing the traditional hero’s or anti-hero’s arc, the protagonist Rach represents both a bold liberation from the “good woman” archetype and an agonized crumbling of her feminist ideals. The film explores whether a woman’s moral transgressions are a betrayal of values or, paradoxically, a radical act of liberation—or, as Lean In experiments, potentially both.\n\nSet against two male-dominated industries, comedy and financial sales, the film critiques systemic gender inequality. Rach, financially defeated in one, seeks status in the other, confronting capitalism and patriarchy head-on. Coleman uses screen production research and feminist film theory to test narrative conventions and push her character toward a brutally honest climax. \nLean In questions neoliberal feminist strategies, echoing critiques such as Catherine Rottenburg’s (2014), that these frameworks often ignore structural inequalities and fail to interrogate male dominance.\n\nThe work sits in conversation with screen narratives like HUSTLERS (Scafaria, 2019), and INDUSTRY (Down, Kay, 2020- ), all of which portray complex women in morally fraught, patriarchal institutions. \n\nInternationally recognised, LEAN IN has received numerous accolades, including:\n--Winner, Best Comedy – Flickerfest \n--Winner, Best Screenplay – Venezia Film Festival\n--Winner, Best Actress (Kartanya Maynard) – Cinefest Oz, NY Shorts, Venezia, St Kilda\n--Nominated, Best Direction – 2024 ADG Awards\n--Ranked 5th Best Australian Film of 2024 by The Curb\n\nThe film’s success led to Screen Australia funding for a TV adaptation, of which Coleman will discuss the continued development of this work and the furthered experimentation and interrogation of female narratives. This ASPERA presentation will use LEAN IN as a core case study to examine the evolving female narrative in screen storytelling.",

In particular it will focus on a screen-based artefact that resulted from this process, namely Elsie (2024). Driven by the research question ‘How might Production Designers apply a feminist film-making practice, as below-the-line practitioners?’, my research project aimed to orient itself towards openness, alterity and collaboration.\n\nI conducted a series of interrelated ‘tests’ of which Elsie is one. The resulting artefact was a collaborative video work that captures both a realised design on screen and the process of making it. Developed alongside 2 co-designers, we sought to understand and actualise, if one was to remove the typical structures and hierarchy supposedly necessary to film production, would it be possible to do feminist filmmaking? What would it look like on and off screen? What would the relationship between doing and representation reveal? \n\nIn this paper, I will outline the conceptual thinking behind Elsie and the broader research project while reflecting on the experimental nature of my research, and considering what enabled or hindered it. Furthermore the paper will reflect on what I gained from this experience as a student, and how it has shaped my perspective as a worker currently employed in the screen industry. \n\nReferences:\n\nClark, R., Drinkwater, E., Douthwaite, G., et al.

          "abstract": "This paper builds on the ‘Women with a Movie Camera’ presentation delivered at the 2024 ASPERA conference at Swinburne University. The original paper examined a three-year series of research-based, female-focused cinematography workshops launched in 2023 at Griffith Film School, covering the project’s conceptualisation, the framework used by the researchers to develop and fund the initiative, and the pedagogical approaches adopted by the research and teaching team to deliver it. This research intervention aimed to increase the number of women working in the camera department on Griffith Film School productions, thereby better preparing students for their filmmaking careers upon graduation and contributing to addressing gender inequality within camera departments in the Australian film industry. \n \nBy 2025, the workshop series concluded, and the data have been collected and analysed. This paper presents participants’ reflections and the outcomes of the ‘Women with a Movie Camera’ research project. It demonstrates the growth in the number of female Directors of Photography across Griffith’s undergraduate final-year productions, offering insights into the role of institutional interventions in addressing gender imbalances within film schools. \n\n",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly embedded within film and screen production workflows—from script development and previsualisation to editing, VFX, and marketing—the creative industries stand on the cusp of transformation. This paper investigates the expanding influence of AI technologies on contemporary filmmaking practices, bringing together a diverse range of perspectives from technologists, filmmakers, educators, and researchers.\n\nBuilding on scholarship that addresses AI’s creative affordances and risks (Manovich, 2020; McCosker & Wilken, 2020), I explore how tools such as generative image models, automated editing, and large language models are being used to augment creative decision-making and reshape production pipelines. Recent industry commentary and podcasts like The Artificial Intelligence Show (Roetzer & Kaput, 2024) offer timely insights into AI's rapid evolution and its impact on the creative industries.\n\nI will also engage with recent reports that highlight both the democratising potential and precarious implications of AI for creative labour. What does this shift mean for authorship, originality, and the labour market within screen industries (Lobato, 2019)? How are educators and institutions responding to the imperative of equipping emerging practitioners with AI literacy while fostering critical engagement?\n\nTopics include generative tools in indie filmmaking, AI-driven localisation, new job roles, continuity automation, and the ethical concerns around data bias, deepfakes, and content provenance (Content Authenticity Initiative, 2024). This session aims to provoke dialogue among ASPERA scholars, screen educators, and creative practitioners about the productive tensions between technological innovation and artistic practice. Are we on the brink of a creative renaissance—or navigating a quiet takeover?\n\n",

          "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into contemporary filmmaking presents significant epistemological and ethical challenges to the concept of cultural authenticity. This paper offers a critical examination of the implications of AI, particularly generative and machine learning models, on representational practices within cinema, with particular emphasis on cultural appropriation and documentary forms. \n\nOriginating from a practice-based investigation in stereoscopic 3D (S3D) filmmaking, the research highlights a tension between the practical efficiencies provided by AI, such as automated stereoscopic conversion and deep learning-based compositing, and the loss of the photographic or lived authenticity that has traditionally been associated with dual-camera realism. It posits that AI's capacity to synthesise cultural artifacts from extensive datasets risks generating representations that, while aesthetically convincing, may lack ontological grounding and community authorship. This concern is especially pronounced in the portrayal of marginalised and indigenous cultures, where appropriation and homogenization pose significant threats. \n\nNonetheless, the paper also explores AI's potential to democratize access to filmmaking tools, thereby empowering culturally embedded creators to enhance their production quality, which could increase their films' chances of achieving mainstream cinematic recognition. Through an interdisciplinary analysis that spans vision science, cultural theory, ethics, and phenomenology, it interrogates the evolving relationship between humans and machines. It proposes that authenticity in the age of AI must be reconceptualised not as a static attribute but as an emergent, relational construct. Ultimately, this study advances a nuanced framework for assessing how AI technologies can both undermine and reshape the aesthetic and ethical foundations of culturally authentic cinema.",

          "title": "Beyond the Turing Test: Agency, Authenticity and a New Framework for AI in Creative Practice",
          "abstract": "Recent empirical studies reveal a paradox in audience reception of AI-generated creative works. For instance, it is common to find research suggesting that AI-generated material (poetry, art, imagery) can be rated more favourably than human-created work (see Bellaiche et al., 2023; Porter & Machery, 2024). However, in almost all of these studies, the preference for Gen-AI work disappears when participants are informed that it was made by/with Gen-AI. This paper posits that these audience reactions are not arbitrary but are rooted in deep cognitive heuristics and folk theories of artifact creation, which hold that value is intrinsically linked to the perceived effort and \"human touch\" of a creator. In the screen media industries, a persistent cultural anxiety surrounding AI is exemplified by creatives demanding \"human stories told by humans.\" Such a view clearly stems from the deep-rooted heuristic bias against AI (or alternatively, a bias toward humans). Consequently, much of the current discourse around creative AI fixates on a “Turing Test fallacy,” where the primary goal is human mimicry. I argue that this focus is a conceptual and creative dead end.\n\nThis paper argues for a conceptual shift away from mimicry and advocates leveraging the unique affordances of AI to explore forms of media that humans would be unlikely, or unable, to create. This transition from a replacement mindset to one of amplification has profound implications for media education. It necessitates a pedagogical evolution away from teaching \"fast(er), cheap(er), but not better” workflows and towards a more robust conceptual curriculum. By situating these arguments within cognitive theories of audience engagement, this presentation offers a framework for understanding and expanding creativity in the age of AI. Ultimately, it calls for an educational focus on creative strategy and critical thinking to prepare students not just to use AI, but to collaborate with it in artistically meaningful ways",

          "abstract": "This presentation reflects on two experimental animation courses designed and taught during my Fulbright Scholar residency at the University of Texas at Dallas in 2025 —one undergraduate, one graduate—that explored how collective experimentation can act as productive forces in screen production education. The courses were shaped by transnational pedagogical influences from Canada, Turkey, and Australia, and asked:\nHow can experimental animation foster not only technical versatility but also\nconceptual resilience in students? And, more broadly, how can we position animation\npractice as a critical mode of inquiry in the face of environmental challenges?\nIn the undergraduate course, students engaged with a wide spectrum of hybrid\nanimation practices. Central to this was pixilation—a technique unfamiliar to most—\nwhich became a site of collaborative experimentation. The class collectively conceived and produced a short film, negotiating both the material demands and creative possibilities of frame-by-frame performance. Embracing imperfection and iterative problem-solving became core learning outcomes.\nThe graduate seminar extended this ethos into the framework of eco-critical and\ncompanion-thinking practices. Drawing from Donna Haraway’s concept of Staying with the Trouble, students engaged with themes of entanglement, sympoiesis, and\necological “response-ability” through hands-on experimentation with pixilation,\nrotoscopy, under the camera stop motion and time-lapse. The course approached\nanimation as a medium capable of embodying complexity, uncertainty, and\ninterdependence, encouraging students to explore the layered relationships between\nhumans, nonhumans, and the act of making. Open to students across disciplines, the\nclass emphasized alternative approaches to storytelling and invited speculative,\naffective responses to the climate crisis.\nBoth courses foregrounded experimentation as not only a technical methodology but a pedagogical stance—valuing uncertainty, multiplicity, and embodied learning. By\nreframing \"failure\" as creative potential, students were empowered to test, question,\nand redefine their relationships with tools, images, and meaning-making.\n",

          "abstract": "This research paper explores a transformative creative process, highlighting how the evocative language of 1930s Sydney poetry continues to resonate today. It emphasises the ways in which these works inspire renewed enthusiasm and support innovative experimental production techniques that challenge conventional boundaries. The output of the research is a series of short experimental video vignettes reversioning poetry to videopotery to illuminate the life and work of Ronald McCuaig described by author Geoffrey Dutton as Australia’s first modern poet. His first collection Vaudeville was considered too controversial for publishers but even printers refused to print the work for fear of prosecution. Through examination of the collection, I recognised its literary significance and was motivated to demonstrate this for a contemporary audience. The experimental engagement with the collection revealed that these literary fragments possess intrinsic archival potential, capable of conveying their own historical import within audiovisual artifacts. The characters in the poems are mostly women, depicted in commonly shrouded urban settings—the resignation in the eyes of a street prostitute painted as ‘beslimed stagnating pools’; and the scene of a woman trapped in domestic abuse culminating in her ‘meditated rape’. \n\nEmploying methodologies derived from archiveology and videopoetry, the collection explores both narrative and non-narrative sequences by integrating archival materials with contemporary footage. The process included collaborating with performers including an Australian hip hop artist, actors, and the Sydney Chamber Choir.  The original linear documentary format was transitioned into an exhibition space featuring original publications, documentary segments, and a dedicated room for the videopotery. More recently, utilising Klynt software, I curated the work into an interactive digital installation, enabling audiences to explore various aspects of the poet's creative output and facilitating the presentation of his life and career to new audiences. \n\nhttps://www.australiasbohemianrapper.com/#Vaudeville_water\n\n\n",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the development of a course for a screen media major entitled Immersive Media. Following from a constrained covid iteration of the course I extended the use of Jonathon Crary's text Techniques of the Observer to move from a limited definition of Immersive Media based in consumerism and the logic of the market, to one more grounded in what I see as the speculative, archaeological, and experimental aspects of immersion as a quality of electronic media and media art. \n\nCrary references Goethe's experience with the Camera Obscura in which he covers its pinhole only to perceive the persistent afterimage of the light imprinted on his retina. Crary figures this a critical juncture at which having 'seen our seeing', the distinction between observer and observed is indelibly complicated. From that point on we were fascinated with perception's dynamics and proclivities in active production of worlds (now irreducibly multiple and constructed and no longer given). Crary then engages in a wonderful media archaeology of 18th century devices that he understands as 'expressions of nonveridical models of perception.' (Crary 1988 p.17). \n\nHere we approach a 'definition' of Immersive Media that I can live with. It is eternally nascent, processual and speculative and a quality as evident (and much more so) in a good Stephen King novel, in Marker's La Jetée, McCall's Line Describing a Cone, in Xenakis’ Metastasis as it is (and much more so) in anything experienced in Meta or Apple Headsets or Spatial Audio devices. \n\nFor me the magic of these non-veridical models of perception, the source of their potential to create worlds, is the magic of the in-between; between frames (animation), between cuts (cinema), between ears/eyes/sources (stereo), between screens (Expanded Cinema), between actions and events (interactivity), and between objects (emergence and computation). This framework provided a way of encouraging screen media students to engage in an experimental media archaeology that explored the in-between, wherever they might locate it, rather than being locked into the modes of production, form and content, overdetermined by barely developed proprietary architectures.\n\n",

While offering richly embodied experiences in their moment of enactment, its ephemerality risks becoming unavailable for future experience. Over the past 20 years, TLC has developed a methodology for knowledge transmission. First, intergenerational transfer is enacted via younger generations learning about the work from its originators, and producing live re-enactments. A user's manual in the second phase encodes the artwork as a set of instructions for future performers and audiences. Thirdly, the archived material from phases one and two is stored on synthetic DNA, with a view to transmission into the deep future.",

Now in its fourth iteration, the Unreal Design Virtual Production Workshop (2025) at AFTRS invites Master’s students in production design, cinematography, and music composition to collaboratively build immersive virtual environments using Unreal Engine and LED volume technologies. \n\nThe workshop draws on world-building, embodied cognition, and participatory creativity to reimagine how students engage with screen space—not as technicians executing a pre-formed vision, but as co-authors shaping narrative through spatial and sonic design. Students begin without a conventional script, engaging instead in open-ended, real-time experimentation where story emerges from the world itself, privileging process over product and challenging linear, hierarchical production models.\n\nThrough participant observation and reflective practice, this research examines how VP enables interdisciplinary experimentation that blurs boundaries between physical and virtual, and between pre- and post-production. Students collaborate in real-time, with iteration, improvisation, and discovery at the core of the process. This fosters what we term sensory storytelling—a mode of distributed authorship that emerges through embodied, audio-spatial world-making.\n\nThis study positions experimental VP pedagogies as essential to preparing students for the evolving landscape of screen production, arguing that embracing uncertainty and risk in educational contexts is key to nurturing the next generation of screen innovators.  \n\n",

          "abstract": "The film and television industry is constantly evolving, with virtual production technology representing a significant leap forward. In-Camera Visual Effects (ICVFX) offer a transformative approach to filmmaking, combining live-action footage with computer-generated environments in real time. However, integrating these workflows into traditional production design introduces new challenges, particularly in achieving a seamless blend of physical sets and virtual elements. Among the primary challenges are simulating depth and concealing stage edges, especially in wide shots that risk exposing the physical limitations of the stage.\n\nThis paper presents experimental techniques for hybrid set design in ICVFX, grounded in practice-led research conducted at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Between 2021 and 2025, a series of short narrative and training films were produced in the QUT Virtual Production Studio in collaboration with Jamieson Trauma Institute. These projects provided a testbed for systematically experimenting with methods to blend physical and digital environments while maintaining immersive realism.\n\nKey experimental approaches explored include parallax layering and forced perspective to simulate depth, and the use of floor pattern extensions and targeted lighting to obscure stage boundaries. Each technique was trialled under real production conditions, allowing the research team to evaluate its effectiveness, identify limitations, and refine workflows iteratively.\n\nThese experiments demonstrate that effective hybrid set design can reduce constraints typically imposed by stage boundaries and enable filmmakers to confidently incorporate a wider range of shot compositions, including wide shots, in ICVFX projects. By sharing these findings, this paper aims to support production designers, directors, and virtual stage operators in optimising their workflows while expanding the creative possibilities of virtual production.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores Disruption (2025)—an experiment in unique narrative film and a forthcoming international television series—as a pedagogical and artistic investigation into reimagining disability representation across TV and cinema. The project—produced and directed by Australians—begins in Singapore, in partnership with SG Enable, before extending to Australia, Vietnam, India, Belgium, and the Middle East, engaging Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) as co-creators—storytellers, improvisors, sound designers, editors, and performers. Drawing from John Cassavetes’ and Mike Leigh’s traditions of improvisation and realism, and from visual legacies such as Bruegel’s The Cripples, German Expressionism, and the fractured geometry of Escher, Disruption seeks a new visual language that reflects the lived experience of disability—an “able-ised” cinematic form that resists sentimentality and tokenism.\n\nThe research responds to global data showing that while over 18% of Americans live with a disability, only 2.4% of on-screen speaking roles reflect this (Easterseals, 2017). Academic precedents from Baumann, Benjamin, Kajita, and Wolbring inform its participatory filmmaking and design-thinking approach, aligning with recent inclusive pedagogical models developed in Singapore (Winstanley et al., 2020). Within this context, Disruption becomes both a film and an educational framework—redesigning screen courses to dismantle industry prejudice and prepare students for inclusive, collaborative production environments.\n\nWith expressed interest from Screen Australia and Screen Queensland, Disruption embodies a transnational dialogue between art, education, and social justice. Through aesthetic experimentation—slow-motion long takes, sensory fragmentation, and subjective soundscapes—the project interrogates the politics of seeing and being seen. At its core lies a commitment to transform systemic inequality through creative disruption, linking pedagogy with professional practice. Ultimately, Disruption envisions a future where disability is reframed as innovation, empathy, and possibility—where screen production education becomes a catalyst for social change and where cinema itself becomes an inclusive mode of perception.",

In an international context mobile, smartphone and pocket films can provide access to filmmaking tools and technologies for a new generation of filmmakers. The smartphone’s accessibility facilitates experimentation and thus can bring new voices to online platforms and cinema screens alike. \n\nThis presentation will review experimentation as an approach for emerging filmmakers to find their creative voice and to engage with creative practice research. “Creating space(s) for Experimentation” will draw upon the Experimental Screen Production unit in the Swinburne Film School. Furthermore, Schleser will emphasise his research led pedagogy to embed innovation in the curriculum. \n\nCreative Practice Research facilitates iterative experimentation, which can redefine the contemporary understanding of production and pedagogy alike. An imaginative and playful engagement with disruptive technologies and emerging media - such as mobile storytelling, smartphone filmmaking or GenAI and synthetic media - is required to understand their limitations and how experimentation can push our understanding about potential future scenarios for independent film. \n\nMoreover, this presentation will explore how spaces for experimentation, such as the Experimental Screen Production unit  and the MINA Smartphone Film Festival, provide a space for experimentation and can lead to novel understandings about screen forms and formats. \n\nWithin the contemporary moving image culture and screen ecologies new production forms and formats appear on the horizon and experimentation is key to understanding these developments. As a Creative Arts researcher, Max Schleser’s research projects are disseminated via Non-Traditional Research Outputs (NTROs) that explore aesthetic refinement. Through experimental and practice-led research Schleser shapes his conceptualisations, he continues to expand screen and film through defining Smartphone filmmaking, Mobile Cinematic VR and the “artificial treatments of actuality”.\n\n",

          "abstract": "Constraint has long been recognised as a productive force in creative practice, from\nmanifesto-driven movements like Dogme 95 to contemporary mobile journalism. In\nscreen production education, however, the focus has often shifted toward ever-greater\naccess to high-end tools and professional workflows. While this has expanded\ntechnical capacity, it has also reinforced the assumption that more equipment and\npolish lead to better filmmaking. This project challenges that assumption by asking\nwhat becomes possible when students are encouraged to work with less rather than\nmore.\n\nSet in Winton, Queensland, during the town’s 150-year anniversary, this practice-led\ndocumentary project invites students to produce short films using only mobile phones,\nmobile journalism kits, natural light, and found locations. These constraints are not\ntechnical limitations but intentional creative choices. Operating under a self-imposed\nframework known as the \"Winton Rules,\" students are asked to slow down, listen\nclosely, and respond sensitively to people and place. The rules restrict intervention but\nencourage immersion, promoting an approach to filmmaking that values presence over\nproduction.\n\nThis methodology takes inspiration from movements such as Dogme 95 and Dogme 25,\nnot as strict templates, but as provocations that continue to offer value to contemporary screen practice. By adapting elements of manifesto thinking to a regional\nand educational setting, the project demonstrates how constraint can sharpen focus,\ndeepen ethical engagement, and foster resourceful collaboration among emerging\nfilmmakers.\n\nThe project outcomes include a series of student-produced documentaries and a\nreflective research paper. Together, they offer a model for constraint-based learning that\nis especially relevant to regional intensives and resource-conscious teaching\nenvironments. More broadly, the work contributes to current conversations about\nsustainability, authenticity, and creative agency in documentary production and\nproposes a rethinking of how screen education frames access, authorship, and\nstorytelling in a mobile-first world.",

          "abstract": "This paper builds upon experimental, expanded, and structuralist filmmaking techniques pioneered by avant-garde practitioners such as Corinne and Arthur Cantrill, Michael Snow, and Hollis Frampton, to explore how a vitalist approach to screen-based technologies might generate innovative forms of moving image production and exhibition. It poses the question: can an awareness of technological ‘liveness’ and materiality open new pathways for cinematic storytelling and screen-based experience?\n\nThroughout cinematic history, the material composition of film and the structure of narrative filmmaking has been shaped by available technologies. As methods of film production and display have evolved, the rate of technological obsolescence has accelerated. Whilst the digital revolution initially appeared to offer a solution to the challenges of material degradation, it has revealed its own limitations, with many digital works now subject to the mortal conditions of aging and decay.\n\nIn response to this state of technological emergency, this paper proposes a radical rethinking of moving image practice—one that consciously engages with the present and speculative futures of screen-based technologies. Through a practice-led research methodology, it reimagines future cinemas as spaces where materiality, narrative, and medium are in active dialogue. Such an approach acknowledges the indexical relationship between image and interface, embracing the ontological conditions of contemporary screens.\n\nAlongside installations and screen-based moving image works, this paper also considers technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and holography to examine works that explicitly engage with the conditions of their own display. Referencing the practices of artists and filmmakers including Tacita Dean and Paula Dawson, it outlines a new framework for moving-image production that is materially aware, narratively inventive, and grounded in practice-as-research.\n\n",

          "abstract": "Shamgods is a performance art comedy project that operates between the live and the mediated, the ironic and the sincere, the real and the fictional. A collaboration between performance makers Matthew Prest, Nitin Vengurlekar and Malcolm Whittaker, Shamgods play with the changing nature of cultural capital by pitting the sacredness and precariousness of the ‘live’ in performance against ways of commodifying it and creating surplus value through ongoing forms of paratextual presence, both online and through performative interventions into everyday life. This project has seen an ever-growing range of products and services, including live performance, a fashion line, lawn and garden care, and a boutique stock footage collection.\n\nThis presentation will explore how Shamgods’ work, particularly our stock footage project (Shamstokk), engages with the fetish of the live as a guarantor of the real, especially in digital, screen-based contexts. Shamstock offers a series of short stock footage videos of the three Shamgods doing various tasks in different settings, for example, “Three men shop for three-quarter length pants in a shopping centre”. These clips parody the stock footage genre while providing a playful frame for task-based, live performance to be captured for the screen and commodified as an art object. Each video is sold with a Certificate of Authenticity, an absurd gesture of validation in the age of generative AI and deepfakes.\n\nThis work resonates with contemporary screen-based projects like Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal (2025) and Tim Heidecker's On Cinema at the Cinema (2011 to present) which similarly trouble the boundaries between performance, content, genre, and reality and reflect a broader cultural desire or preference for authenticity and immediacy as examined in the recent scholarship of cultural theorist Anna Kornbluh (2024), media theorists Gunn Enli (2014) and Michael Serazio (2023) and theatre scholar Daniel Schulze (2017).",

Installed in conversation with other artists working across video art, expanded cinema, and fine art, In the Making investigates how digital media can prompt embodied attention and relational encounter through moving image practice in a gallery setting. The work forms part of a broader research inquiry into how screen-based practices can move beyond representation to engage audiences through sensory, affective, and material means, contributing to a deeper understanding of how creative encounters support individual and collective wellbeing. Rather than assuming that showing something leads to change, this project explores how digital art can activate embodied and affective engagement that prompts deeper, felt connection. It experiments with modalities that are active, embodied, situated and relational, drawing the viewer into a space that is as much felt as it is seen (Marks, 2002). Documentation of the work will be incorporated into this presentation. The discussion reflects on the installation as a method of practice-led research, where form and encounter become tools for inquiry. The work explores how visual layering, material–digital interplay, and audience movement can generate a mode of spectatorship that is attentive, open, and relational, while gently reconfiguring conventional ways of looking. In doing so, it positions experimentation not as aesthetic deviation, but as a critical approach to thinking through how screen practices might operate differently, within galleries, across bodies, and in dialogue with the conditions that shape perception and response.\n\nReference\nMarks, Laura U.

          "abstract": "What happens when film students are asked not to make a film? This paper explored the pedagogical value of inviting Bachelor of Screen Production students to engage in non-screen creative experimentation – such as painting, staging performance pieces, or crafting poetry – as a means of deepening their awareness of process, play, and personal voice. Drawing on Schön’s concept of the “reflective practitioner” this presentation argues that shifting the creative task away from the pressure of film output can liberate students from performance anxiety, enabling a more embodied, affective, and exploratory approach to developing a creative practice and lifestyle. \nOffered during workshops and assessments throughout two units of the Excelsia College/Sydney Film School Bachelor of Screen Production, students were encouraged to respond to thematic prompts using any medium except screen. The removal of traditional filmic frameowkrs created a rupture in habitual working patterns. The goal was an increased willingness to take creative risks, to fail productively, and to reflect critically on their assumptions and creative habits. \nThis paper situates these findings within broader discourses of practice-led research and creative pedagogies that value process over product (Haseman, 2006). It also draws connections within the principles of slow scholarship and arts-based inquiry, offering an alternative to models of creative education focused exclusively on measurable outputs. \nThrough examples of student work and classroom dialogue, this presentation illustrates how stepping away from the screen can ultimately bring students closer to understanding their own voice as screen practitioners as well as trouble shooting creative blocks. This presentation offers a potential intervention into how we might prepare students not just to make films, but to navigate the unknowns of creative practice itself. \n\n",

          "abstract": "In identifying how a lecturer's external practises can enhance screen production education, we must acknowledge the balance of commitment and compromise in consistent cycles of creative disruption. In a recent survey of piano tutors, almost 70% of participants saw themselves as teachers who also perform. Despite outstanding external achievements, and likely due to their enthusiasm for teaching, most pupils perceived them as teachers who occasionally perform (Rice-See, L. 2003, as cited in Haldane, C.R 2018). \nUnderstandably, most creative tutors desire more time to practise outside the classroom. While this may be difficult to manage, it is important to note that ongoing practise has a strong correlation to improved teaching abilities. For example, high-performing teachers who are active in their field must exhibit certain entrepreneurial and problem-solving skills to balance multiple roles and run successful lessons (Bennett, D. 2016). In navigating the demands of dual careers, these practical skills will better serve their students in preparing them for the industry. As a musician, an independent filmmaker and a producing lecturer, I consistently incorporate cross-disciplinary examples of transferrable skills in my teaching. Outside classroom discussions around networking and industry politics, my engagement with students ranges from working alongside them on the sets of my music videos, to chaperoning them at conferences such as Screen Forever, where they witness me operating as a freelance practitioner, pitching my projects at roundtables. This is why professional development grants are essential to furthering career growth and strengthening a department’s resources from the inside. As a freelancer, I constantly encounter opportunities for students to collaborate and gain experience on real-world projects. By staying active, I’m mixing with professionals who make for highly qualified lectures or workshop hosts, bringing contemporary concepts and original ideas to the classroom. In most cases, such teaching opportunities come as a welcomed break for these practitioners, who are honoured to share their insights with the next generation. In conclusion, there is much evidence to support that the lifestyle and skills associated with being a multi-disciplinary practitioner creates better learning opportunities when combined with a modern teaching approach centred on creative problem-solving, networking and a healthy work-life balance.

          "abstract": "“Mumblecore” was coined in 2005 at SXSW festival (San Filippo, 2011) where a group of emerging filmmakers' films were programmed together, benefitting from a new approach to festival programming. These were all low budget films about self-discovery that explored relationships, where media discourse was significant in shaping their narrative approach. This presentation examines how mumblecore adopts metacinematic techniques (Canet 2014) with a view to informing the creative development of an original mumblecore screenplay: Hannah got stuck on the stairs. Canet appropriates Jacques Gerstenkorn’s mirror analogy claiming that metacinema can be divided into two aspects or two mirrors. In the mirror of cinematic reflexivity, Canet proposes cinema sees itself in its own reflection, where the film is about film, driven by a narrative of a main character involved in or making a film (Canet, 2014). The second is a mirror of filmic reflexivity in which film history is reflected in the context of ‘playing mirrors with other films’ (Canet, 2014). Textual analysis has identified the way in which mumblecore filmmakers incorporate the two mirrors of cinematic and filmic reflexivity where the films are often about the process of making a film or the films include references to other films. Early findings suggest a third mirror of self-reflexivity that offers an experimental narrative framework for mumblecore script development.",

This paper explores the development of a new first-year subject in the Bachelor of Communication and Media for the Digital and Social Media major at the University of Wollongong. Tentatively and exploratorily titled ‘Designing and Directing AI Media’, this subject (to launch in 2027) builds on the human-centered approach of the open access course ‘Introduction to AI Image Generation’ launched in Autumn 2025. The new subject will provide a space for students to embrace the uncertainty of AI-generated video to be shared via social media platforms as short-form content.\nThe subject and this paper will address the conference theme by positioning\nexperimentation as essential learning for media and communication graduates\nnavigating AI and labour as part of the contingencies of contemporary screen\nproduction. The subject will be platform and technology-agnostic, recognising that AI\ntools evolve faster than curriculum. It will build students’ capacity for divergent and\nconvergent thinking and support iterative experimentation.\nProgrammatic assessment is crucial for the innovation that allows students to take\nrisks with AI-generated media, and the andragogical innovation in the new subject will\ncontinue the Digital and Social Media major’s development of the ‘digital artifact’\nprogram of study. The digital artifact provides conditions under which students\nexperiment with video material for diverse audiences, learning to direct AI tools\nresponsibly and ethically within the presentational media paradigm of social platforms.\nThe new course will continue the program’s celebration of failure and iteration, with a\nfocus on students' reflection on learning, as the digital artifact does not consider the\nmedia product directly. This approach embraces experimentalism, real-time iteration,\nand feedback cycles in and out of the classroom. The new subject will prepare students for communication and expression in a creative industries environment that\nwill increasingly involve non-human agents. ",

Undertaken by Lab \nresearchers and educators, the project explores the creative, aesthetic, and \nconceptual potential of generative AI tools through a series of fortnightly, AI-led game \ndesign experiments.\nEach design sprint requires participants to use machine-generated assets, visuals, \ncode, sound, and narrative within thematic or formal constraints. Only limited manual \nediting or non-AI inputs are allowed. The process is framed through an action research \nmethodology, with each cycle structured around planning, creation, reflection, and \nadaptation. This approach allows the Lab to investigate the evolving dynamics of \nauthorship, agency, and aesthetic control when designing with tools that operate semiautonomously and often unpredictably.\nThe project explores what it means to engage in creative experimentation in an era of \nmachine-generated media. It asks how AI might extend, subvert, or complicate \napproaches to screen production and research, particularly in relation to process, \ndesign, and creative risk. By treating generative AI as both a speculative collaborator \nand a volatile design partner, the project invites new ways of thinking about screenbased creativity, constraint, and failure.\nRather than focusing on finished outputs, The AI Game Jam Project positions \nexperimentation itself as a site of inquiry, foregrounding the tension between human \ncreative intent and machinic output. It challenges participants to reflect on their \nrelationship to screen tools, genre conventions, and emerging aesthetics shaped by \nalgorithmic systems.\nThis paper reflects on the project's first iteration, offering insight into how short-form, \nconstraint-driven design can inform practice-led research and contribute to broader \nconversations about screen media experimentation, speculative production, and the \nevolving role of creative agency. The resulting prototypes reflect the tools that shaped \nthem and reveal emerging patterns, genres, and creative instincts specific to AImediated production. In this way, the project contributes to theoretical and creative \nunderstandings of how artificial intelligence can influence and reshape screen \npractice",

Initially an attempt to engage online students during Covid-19, after the quiz I asked the class to consider the elements that make songs great, and how those elements could apply to their own projects. While comparisons between popular music and video forms are inexact, links can be made between ‘a sound’ (instrumentation and arrangement) and ‘a look’ (style), or between melody and story. Other discussion points include rhythmic patterns, dynamics, tempo and pacing, or whether production might be ‘raw’ or polished. Structure or genre can be addressed, lyrics can be compared with content or dialogue etc. The exercise enables students to experiment with conceptual, narrative and stylistic approaches to their work, to clarify the intended outcomes of their production process, and consider the options for re/writing in the edit. The exercise could be used for documentary, narrative or experimental works, collaborative or individual. In lieu of an in-class discussion, it could form a case study assessment, or part of a presentation. As most students will have listened to thousands of pop songs but viewed very few short films, either narrative or documentary, this is an engaging way to experiment with creative practice.",

          "abstract": "Despite the wealth of discussion, literature and content involving the uncanny as a conceptual premise, there remains demonstrably less focus and attention on its existence within non-narrative, non-human-based media, particularly on how sonic and visual elements can enhance it. Notably explored by psychologist Sigmund Freud in his essay Das Unheimliche, the uncanny relates to the strangeness between the familiar being made unfamiliar and vice versa, blurring the boundaries between the two. In popular discussion, uncanniness has been primarily associated with the ‘off- human’, such as with the term 'uncanny valley’, extending to virtual or real-life humanoids imitating human and human behaviour and the sense of unease this can cause within us. However, this creative practice-led research thesis is concerned with examining how this sense of uncanny can be instead evoked through environmental space and whether the blurring boundary between recognition and un/familiarity within environments has the ability to lead to the uncanny sense of unease. A key focus for this research is the exploration of how audiovisual elements, such as music, sound, colour, shape, and light, can enhance uncanniness within an environment. Through the development of an experimental audiovisual virtual work, The Other Edis, this concept is explored in an interactive VR (virtual reality) experience which allows users to navigate at their own pace, moving through the thirteen unique environments and experiencing the changing sonic and visual elements as they do so. Using ‘audiovisual concrète’, a hybrid creative method combining experimental DIY (Do-It-Yourself) bricolage processes with elements reminiscent of Pierre Schaeffer’s experimental music genre musique concrète, this work features an original score and visual design crafted as part of the research, ultimately exploring how audiovisual concrète can be used as a method for evoking uncanniness within non-narrative, environment-based work.",

          "abstract": "There is increasing focus on worldbuilding in screen practice “as artists create compelling environments that cannot be fully explored or exhausted within a single work or even a single medium” (Jenkins, 2006, p. 14). This shift towards world-driven storytelling demands a rethinking of traditional approaches to filmmaking to meet the growing screen-spectator demand for cohesive and immersive storyworlds with potential for narrative and multi-platform expansion. For this reason, there is an imperative for screen practitioners to adapt craft practices (through innovation in tools, methods and creative processes) to serve increasingly complex, layered, and coherent transmedial storytelling environments. \n\nThis paper documents my efforts as a screen music composer to professionalise and systematise  experimentation and creativity in a storyworld-focused way. In doing so, I propose an alternative approach to screen music composition that systematises a composer’s creative process with a focus on storyworld. Through creative practice research I have developed a Musical Worldbuilding Schema that synthesises principles of worldbuilding in screen productions with principles of screen music. The Musical Worldbuilding Schema scaffolds the ideation and creative process to facilitate intentional exploratory screen composing practice responsive to the unique elements of any given  storyworld.\n\nThis research engages with worldbuilding scholarship in narratology (Goodman, 1978; Jenkins, 2006; Herman, 2009; and others) in the development of the Musical Worldbuilding Schema. Through practical application of the schema to three short artefacts of different forms – fiction and experimental – I demonstrate how experimentation with storyworld-focused film scores can strengthen creativity and enhance audience immersion. Thus, while this paper focuses on alternative storyworld-driven methods that optimise experimentation in screen music practice, it also more broadly supports the bodies of research advancing professional experimentation and worldbuilding in filmmaking.\n\nReferences \nGoodman, N.

          "abstract": "Storyworlds provide enriching contexts for stories: they shape the dimensions of time and space and situate narratives within knowable cultural situations. Traditional approaches to story development consider a storyworld to be a force that contains or limits narrative, but twenty-first century storytelling increasingly pushes against these boundaries to demand storyworlds that can generate multiple stories across multiple media platforms that engage diverse audiences. In this contemporary context, there is a need for storyworld development to be expansive and potentially unlimited. \n\nExpansive storyworld development requires reappraisal of screen production norms to to consider creative methodologies, processes, and collaboration models, as well as legal-industrial procedures. While conventional approaches to storytelling are largely dominated by character-driven and plot-driven storytelling models, world-driven models centre setting, place and expansive environments as causal narrative agents. A world-driven approach to storytelling can work in tandem with traditional character-driven and plot-driven models or – in more radical ways – can provide an alternative storytelling and production framework. \n\nGlobally, world-driven storytelling has resonated within popular culture and industrial structures: the dominance of serialised ‘share universes’ and expansive multiplatform storyworlds in contemporary entertainment reflects how this model exists in conventional screen practice. Nonetheless, world-driven storytelling remains relatively explorative and unrecognised in the Australian screen industries: examples such as ‘Mad Max,’ ‘Miss Fisher,’ ‘Cleverman,’ and ‘Mystery Road’ exemplify efforts to engage with expansive storyworld development in the Australian content, but the world-driven approach of these examples has been undervalued and understated as a viable model in the Australian national context. To be sure, world-driven storytelling provides opportunities to promote community, ecology, and spatial or place-based modes of creative expression, which has the potential to resonate with Australian values and stories. This paper will survey existing efforts to experiment with world-driven storytelling and discuss ways to approach storyworld development in Australia. ",

          "abstract": "Educational thinking around diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) has fostered environments where every student, regardless of background, feels valued and empowered through innovative pedagogical practices (Bhardwaj & Mittal, 2024). These alternate practices are essential to address the diverse needs of contemporary adult learners in the MA Screen Business (MASB) at the Australian Film Television and Radio (AFTRS). These media leaders who often juggle professional, personal and educational pressures while studying, the flexibility of alternative assessments has been integral to expedient course completion for Australia’s emerging producers and screen business leaders. The MASB is the only award course at AFTRS that offers a part-time and remote learning, fostering an inclusive learning environment.\n \nHenry and Maric (2023) reported educators and students were more likely to embrace change after broader shifts and pedagogical questions for screen production since COVID-19. When restrictions shut down screen production in Australia, many tertiary film schools cancelled, suspended, or reworked for an online learning environment (Dooley, K. et al, 2024). In the Master of Screen Business (MASB) at AFTRS, online and blended delivery options were already in place, allowing faculty to deliver ‘core skills effectively, how to engage students, and how to prepare them for the evolving screen industries’ (Henry and Maric, 2023: 13).\n \nUsing a case study approach, this paper outlines the how alternative assessment frameworks that promote DEI strategies have been trialled. in the MASB. Innovative pedagogical practices play a crucial role in promoting accessibility, catering to students' varied needs and strengths, and promoting equity and inclusivity in learning (Garcia, 2020). Research shows that diverse educational environments enhance critical thinking and creativity among students, preparing them for a globalized world (Brown & Lee, 2021). By embracing innovation in assessments, educators can create transformative educational experiences that celebrate diversity and foster a sense of belonging among students (Bhardwaj, & Mittal, 2024). The evolution of assessment mechanisms within the MASB has levelled the playing field for different styles of learning, provided more meaningful reflection and higher processing abilities and problem-solving\n\n",

My thesis, 'Passion vs. Profession: The Emotional and Financial Costs of Zero-Budget Filmmaking for Immigrant Filmmakers in Australia,' examines the distinct experiences and challenges encountered when driven by passion rather than financial backing.\nWhile filming for *The Book* has not commenced yet, the pre-production process has highlighted the power of resourceful collaboration in overcoming budgetary limitations. With UTS providing access to vital resources such as film equipment and studio space, as well as knowledge and guidance, our project thrives on the collective creativity of those involved, rather than relying on funding.\nThe screenplay was crafted in a way that aligns with our available resources, prioritising accessible locations and minimal production design. I will be working closely with acting students and emerging crew members from various film schools and acting schools, all of whom have a passion and commitment to creating meaningful work despite financial hurdles.\nThis paper reflects on how embracing zero-budget filmmaking not only opens doors for diverse voices often sidelined by traditional industry practices but also fosters inclusive, experimental spaces for shared learning and resilience. \nUltimately, my goal is to demonstrate to aspiring filmmakers that authentic and impactful cinema can be achieved through passion-driven collaboration, innovation, and determination—especially in the face of financial constraints. This paper reflects on how embracing zero-budget filmmaking not only opens pathways for diverse voices traditionally excluded by conventional filmmaking structures but also creates inclusive, experimental spaces for shared learning and resilience.\nThrough critical reflection, production diaries, and ongoing conversations with collaborators, my research explores how emotional commitment and financial hardship influence creative decisions. Ultimately, this paper aims to demonstrate to future filmmakers that authentic, impactful cinema is achievable through passion-driven collaboration, innovation, and determination, despite—or perhaps because of—financial constraints.\n\n",

          "abstract": "Despite overwhelming evidence of the efficacy of research-driven education focused children’s AV content on reception, cognition, bias and development (Turkmen, 2020; Alehpour & Abdollahyan, 2022; Praveen & Srinivasan, 2022; González, et al, 2020), neither Screen Australia, nor the ABC are funding educational television content. ABC Education will acquire finished AV content but will not fund its research or development. \nThe Wonderful, Fluorescent, Massive World of Tiny Invisible Things (WONDER) is a screen-based research project bridging this gap between the children’s TV industry, education and the academy.\nThe WONDER project reimagines children’s science storytelling through hybrid documentary, foregrounding visual experimentation and cinematic form as central tools for engagement and inclusion. Drawing on international scholarship that positions hybrid documentary as a site of formal and conceptual hybridity (Moody 2013; Slugan 2021), this project applies this framework to children’s STEM content—an area typically shaped by information-driven, non-narrative approaches.\nThe projects visual strategy is to anthropomorphise real scientists, fusing their identities with the microscopic entities they study. Through character-driven animation and narrative metaphor, scientists are embodied within the vivid, fluorescent 3D imagery informed by their research. This experimental fusion of documentary realism with speculative animation reconfigures representation, offering role models who are both authentic and imaginative, bridging emotional and intellectual access to scientific knowledge.\nAimed at 11–12 year-olds—particularly girls, who are disproportionately lost to STEM pathways at this age—the project challenges entrenched visual norms and learning models in science education drawing on interdisciplinary evidence of how embodiment, narrative, and animation support cognitive engagement and identity formation (Gallese et al., 2011; Bian et al., 2017; See Jane, 2023). \nThis work asserts animation as more than moving illustrations: it becomes an investigative method and aesthetic inquiry. It explores visual and embodied storytelling, can make the invisible visible, disrupt gendered assumptions and engage young audiences redefining screen-based pedagogy. \n\nReference list available\n\n\n",

          "abstract": "What you see is not always all you get. In the context of concept art and character design, a field with a very loaded and thoughtful creative process, this statement could be construed as especially pliable in the practice of anthropomorphising inanimate objects and contributing to the illusion of life. This paper describes, analyses and evaluates a series of character-focused illustrated and animated content with the intention of providing relative practitioners with an alternative perspective into this creative process, by assessing methods of research that have led into the creation of anthropomorphic musical instrument characters inspired by internal and external stimuli, specifically referencing semiotics and the sensory phenomena of synesthesia and pareidolia. These influential phenomena may occur naturally or be employed deliberately to warp an artist’s perception and produce an entirely original creative artifact, and this paper details how each have been manipulated in the context of musical animation. Regardless of the origins of the inspiration, conscious or unconscious, the general practice of character design and concept art as a whole yield a certain philosophy and thought pattern that drives the maker from the original concept and methodology to the point where the final output inevitably takes on a life of its own as a product in animation, music, games, interactivity or other media.",

          "abstract": "This research investigates doodling as a methodological approach to animation, proposing it as a playful, improvisational, and sustainable creative process. Drawing on cycles of reflective practice and experimental making, it positions doodling not merely as informal sketching, but as a potential animation method that embraces uncertainty, offers an alternative to conventional production workflows, and foregrounds embodied, intuitive forms of knowledge.\nSet against the increasingly technologised and industrialised landscape of screen production, the project resists rigid pre-production-to-post-production models, instead embracing spontaneity and iterative experimentation. Through conceptual framing, literature review, and animated outputs, the research demonstrates how doodling can sustain creative flow, support animator well-being, and generate alternative storytelling structures.\nThis practice-led research explores doodling as an animation method through a two-stage process: a systematic autoethnographic inquiry involving fieldwork, followed by the creation of an animated short film. The autoethnographic approach enables the researcher to reflect on personal experiences and situate them within broader animation practices, using doodling as a lens to examine creative flow and embodied process. The first stage documents the researcher’s engagement with doodling in both form and practice, while the second synthesises these insights into an animated output, positioning the film and its making as a reflective and revelatory research outcome.\nThe research contributes to an underexplored area in animation studies by theorising animation through its making. By situating experimentation at the heart of both creative practice and theoretical reflection, it offers a framework that is responsive to the needs of screen production education—valuing process over product, uncertainty over certainty, and curiosity over convention.",

          "title": "Hypernostalgiavision: A transnational mode of fictional nostalgic television for our time?",
          "abstract": "Hypernostalgiavision is a self-defined term that refers to an innovative mode of fictional nostalgic television inspired by recent series from the United States that explore tensions between nostalgia and social change: Mad Men (AMC, 2007-15), Stranger Things (Netflix, 2016-), This is Us (NBC, 2016-22), and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon Prime Video,\n2017-23). The mode juxtaposes hegemonic aesthetic or tonal “restorative nostalgia” with substantive “reflective nostalgia” (both terms coined by Svetlana Boym, The Future of Nostalgia, 2001), that is, narrative or formal elements that problematise the subject nostalgia. This juxtaposition creates a self-aware “vision”- a space for critical reflection on historical memory, national identity, and the ideological function of nostalgia. \n\nThrough my practice-based PhD research, I adopt, conceptualise and illustrate hypernostalgiavision to create Talent Quest, an Australian limited television series set in 1980s Sydney. Drawing from personal experience in a multi-generational migrant family with a complex history as Italian and Maltese nationals in British-occupied Egypt (mutamassirun), the series challenges dominant narratives of Australian identity and multiculturalism. It interrogates how nostalgia can both obscure and illuminate marginalised, diverse histories. Through techniques of fictionalisation, subjective memory, and anachronism, the project explores migration, ethnicity, and trauma while complicating notions of national progress and hegemonic identity. \n\nMy research confirms the potential of hypernostalgiavision as a transnational framework for reinterpreting the mediated past to shape contemporary discourse. At a time when nostalgia is weaponised by capitalism, cultural industries, and nationalist movements, it offers a way to critically reflect on the past while preserving emotional resonance and broad cultural appeal.  In a fragmented media landscape defined by algorithmic silos and the erosion of shared cultural spaces, hypernostalgiavision counters nostalgic indulgence and bridges ideological divides, foregrounds marginalised voices, and expands the possibilities of fictional nostalgic television for contemporary times.\n\n",

(Young, T., 1963)\n\nThis paper explores the pedagogical value of mentoring 20 emerging filmmakers as part of the Sabah Film Lab during the 2024 Kota Kinabalu International Film Festival (KKIFF) Malaysia… and how this enriches my teaching of filmmaking practice in Australian higher education.\n\nPositioned within a cross-cultural and collaborative framework, the Sabah Film Lab mentoring process saw industry practitioners and educators from Japan (Hikaru Todu - director/ documentary-maker); New Zealand (Roy Taoho - cinematographer); and Australia (Mark Overett - writer/producer) led by four Malaysian mentors (Isazaly Isa - editor/VFX supervisor; Putri Purivama Sugua –documentary-maker; Ahmad Yazid - producer/director; and Chris Perreira - videographer), guiding emerging filmmakers from Malaysia and The Philippines through the entire filmmaking process in two parts: from ideation and scripting (via online) to production and post production (on location) in Sabah. This provided a dynamic platform for experiential learning, intercultural exchange and creative (experimental) problem-solving. This immersive, project-based learning model aligns with\nconstructive pedagogies that emphasise learning though doing. (Kolb, 1984).\n\nThe goal of the programme was to shoot and edit four short films to within 10 days… with the “finished” films to be screened on the final night of the film festival. These films covered a variety of genres: a documentary on the rise of samba dance clubs in Sabah; a drama about two grieving\nsisters dealing with the death of their father; a drama about a young woman also coming to terms with her father’s death through her interpretation of ethnic dance; and a dramedy of miscommunication on a first date.\n\nIn the Australian classroom, I draw upon mentoring experiences such as this (and my previous work leading documentary pitching workshops for KKIFF), to cultivate a more inclusive, proactive and globally-aware curriculum. The Sabah Film Lab participants had to deal with the same issues as per on any student set: working extremely long hours; low budgets; mental and physical health issues; enduring creative disagreements on set; actor reliability etc. The collaborative nature of the Sabah Film Lab projects has reinforced the importance of teamwork, adaptability and empathy – skills that are essential for our students in an increasingly competitive global industry.\n\nAs noted by Marginson and Sawir (2011), transnational educational experiences can enhance intercultural competence and global citizenship. Universal answers to specific problems: by sharing my experiences working with overseas productions and showing and discussion of these films, I\nprovide Australian students, and indeed my fellow lecturers, with a tangible, relevant example of how cross-cultural collaboration can enrich creative outcomes, solve local production issues and broaden professional horizons.\n\nIn conclusion, immersing myself in such environments enhances my ability to teach adaptive production strategies, resourceful storytelling and efficient crew management – skills that are increasingly vital in contemporary screen industries.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nKolb, D.

With the object of an ordinary Chinese Village, this ‘Spatial Cinema’ project explores in mimesis ideas of central to Daoism and Deleuzian “assemblages” (Deleuze & Guattari 1980).\n\nScholars have noted the spatial and temporal correspondences between western process orientated thought and Daoism. (Bogue et al., 2014, Wang 2012, Jullien 1996) Following this tradition, this project begins with ‘dirty scans’ – point clouds of an urban village in Fujian, China, visited in the narrative of 7th Month Return by hungry ghosts or wandering spirits - 游魂 – of local folklore. (Wu 2019) The depiction of point-cloud imagery – 3D coordinates in XYZ space with RGB values - articulate a synchronic vision of space and proximity in moving image and link to the cultural practices of villagers in the 7th Month. The ‘dirty scans’ of the mimesis are contingent and provisional practice of point cloud media acquisition, a product of an encounter and movement through spaces rather than an accurate spatial definition. \n\nThis exploration on the intersection of digital media and folklore has implications for practices of virtual heritage beyond the claims for digital verisimilitude and twinning. (Champion 2021) A positioning of theories, media, and art objects in relation to each other, exploring their connections and mutual influences, allows for creative reframings of heritage, foregrounding context and contemporary relevance.",

      "abstract": "This co-presented research paper (or short themed panel) concerns the production of a ~ 30 mins VR and dome-cinema documentary, \"Vaka Moana: Ancestors of the Future\". The subject of the work is the historic voyages that facilitated the settling of the Polynesian Pacific (~1000BC – 1200AD).\n\nWe will discuss the ways in which understandings of aesthetics, emotions and the\nhuman body have been applied to this work as a documentary film - that is, as a work\nthat seeks to engage with and represent ‘actuality’ and ‘the real’. And from here we will\nbriefly explore the aesthetic possibilities of this technology more broadly.\n\nIn this, we note the ancient Greek heritage of aisthesis, a term concerned with the\nperception of feeling and attending to the sensory interpretation of reality. It was a\nconcept, Terry Eagleton has written, that was originally conceived as a ‘discourse of the body.’ Likewise, as Katie Barclay has written, the etymological root of the word\n‘emotion’ (the Latin emovere) is ‘to move’. Emotion was also conceived as a discourse\nregarding the ‘physical embodiment of the ideas and experiences that produced social, political, cultural and other types of change’.\n\nThis idea of emotional movement is also relevant to the aspirations of this screen-work, which carries a social-change agenda. Specifically, it expresses the sentiment that Polynesian Indigenous knowledge is significant to the urgent and necessary mitigation of climate change and global environmental degradation.\n\nEmploying poetic-aesthetic narrative tools to the immersive media environment, we\nhave attempted to create a particular kind of cinematic space that is both embodied\nand emotive. Some analogues apply here to the inter-cultural ‘meeting place’\ndescribed by artist-scholar Paul Carter.\n\nIt is an immersive and feeling-full aesthetic and we hope that bodies are moved and\nemotions are provoked.\n\nSelected References:\n\nBarclay, Katie (2017) ‘Introduction: Emotions and Change’, Emotions: History, Culture,\nSociety 1(2) : pp.1–9.\n\nCarter, Paul (2013) Meeting Place: The Human Encounter and the Challenge of\nCoexistence.

          "abstract": "This co-presented research paper (or short themed panel) concerns the production of a ~ 30 mins VR and dome-cinema documentary, \"Vaka Moana: Ancestors of the Future\". The subject of the work is the historic voyages that facilitated the settling of the Polynesian Pacific (~1000BC – 1200AD).\n\nWe will discuss the ways in which understandings of aesthetics, emotions and the\nhuman body have been applied to this work as a documentary film - that is, as a work\nthat seeks to engage with and represent ‘actuality’ and ‘the real’. And from here we will\nbriefly explore the aesthetic possibilities of this technology more broadly.\n\nIn this, we note the ancient Greek heritage of aisthesis, a term concerned with the\nperception of feeling and attending to the sensory interpretation of reality. It was a\nconcept, Terry Eagleton has written, that was originally conceived as a ‘discourse of the body.’ Likewise, as Katie Barclay has written, the etymological root of the word\n‘emotion’ (the Latin emovere) is ‘to move’. Emotion was also conceived as a discourse\nregarding the ‘physical embodiment of the ideas and experiences that produced social, political, cultural and other types of change’.\n\nThis idea of emotional movement is also relevant to the aspirations of this screen-work, which carries a social-change agenda. Specifically, it expresses the sentiment that Polynesian Indigenous knowledge is significant to the urgent and necessary mitigation of climate change and global environmental degradation.\n\nEmploying poetic-aesthetic narrative tools to the immersive media environment, we\nhave attempted to create a particular kind of cinematic space that is both embodied\nand emotive. Some analogues apply here to the inter-cultural ‘meeting place’\ndescribed by artist-scholar Paul Carter.\n\nIt is an immersive and feeling-full aesthetic and we hope that bodies are moved and\nemotions are provoked.\n\nSelected References:\n\nBarclay, Katie (2017) ‘Introduction: Emotions and Change’, Emotions: History, Culture,\nSociety 1(2) : pp.1–9.\n\nCarter, Paul (2013) Meeting Place: The Human Encounter and the Challenge of\nCoexistence.

          "title": "Hyperphotography revisited: aesthetic journalism in a post-Flash world",
          "abstract": "In 2009, Fred Ritchin outlined a vision for digital journalism that invited photographers to think beyond the two-dimensional limits of the photographic frame. Digital images were not merely windows to a fixed place and moment, Ritchin argued, but a mosaic of liquid possibilities capable of affording context, multiple narratives, and nuance. Ritchin called his vision hyperphotography (Ritchin, 2009). On the one hand, it was a technological proposal: a combination of pixels and hypertext that embraced innovative modes of interactive storytelling; but at its heart, hyperphotography was a response to the moral concerns of the moment. Ritchin proposed a way of maintaining, if not rebuilding, trust in photojournalism’s claim to authenticity, and he addressed Susan Sontag’s famous criticism that photography was incapable of providing context (Sontag, 2008). In an age of image proliferation and manipulation, hyperphotography provided visual journalism with ongoing moral value.\n\nIn the subsequent decade, innovative projects emerged from newsrooms around the world as digital journalists explored the multi-dimensional possibilities of screen-based communication. Adobe Flash was used to produce award-winning stories on slow-burn issues such as African migrations to Australia (SBS, 2010) and the diverse social makeup of New York City (NYTimes.com, 2009). These immersive documentaries, and others like them, enjoyed mixed success. Some focussed too heavily on the bells and whistles of interactivity at the expense of clear and engaging storytelling, and they emerged during a time of disruption, when digital communication pivoted from webpages towards mobile apps and social platforms (Hermida and Young, 2021; Anderson and Wolff, 2010); but because Flash projects were frequently concerned with photography’s ability to communicate complex social issues, the projects proved to be more than just another example of ‘hype’ (Hermida and Young, 2021). Instead, they embodied a culture of communication that explored a simple question: what can photography do? When Flash became unsupported in 2020, a decade of discursive practices disappeared amidst the broken links. This project investigates these projects and discusses the possibility of rescuing them from the archive. \n\n",

          "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental methodology for creating multimodal documentary experiences that bridge historical trauma with contemporary humanitarian crises through innovative cross-disciplinary approaches. Building on our established multi-platform Holocaust project Sorella's Story, we introduce We Were Children Once, a hybrid documentary that combines 360-VR filmmaking with an extended experience wall projection installation to create spatially-aware narrative experiences.\n\nOur practice-led research challenges traditional documentary boundaries by developing an experimental approach that integrates fictional child narratives with authentic Holocaust survivor testimonies, employing AI-driven voice synthesis to blend the child actor and survivor (with permission from both participants). The extended wall experience introduces contemporary child voices from conflict zones, creating intergenerational dialogue between Holocaust survivors and children experiencing current wars.\n\nThe hybrid structure consists of two interconnected components: a 15-minute CVR experience positioning viewers in an abandoned school classroom where four children share survival stories drawn from Holocaust survivor interviews, followed by a responsive wall installation, displaying animated photographs and testimonials from children in current conflict zones. This creates what we identify as \"embodied transition methodology\" - moving audiences from immersive virtual environments into physical spaces that extend narrative engagement beyond traditional viewing and historical/contemporary contexts.\n\nOur spatial documentary storytelling techniques include:\n1. Multimodal transitions between virtual and physical spaces.\n2. AI-driven voice synthesis and temporal transformation. \n3. Embodied perspective-taking.\n4. Extended-experience storytelling. \n5. Impact and message-led story-design.\n\nOur experimental approach demonstrates how emerging technologies can create ethical frameworks for representing trauma narratives across temporal boundaries. Through safe in/safe out protocols and behavioural intention changes, we contribute evidence-based methodologies to harness immersive technologies for social justice advocacy. This research expands documentary methodology by proving that multimodal approaches can effectively combat audience issue fatigue, reach diverse audience segments, and offer frameworks for addressing historical trauma through contemporary technological innovation.",

          "abstract": "As Screen Studies has evolved and expanded within the academy, its role in film schools—especially in the education of emerging filmmakers—deserves renewed attention. Film schools have traditionally paired filmmaking instruction with the study of screen history and theory, yet the increasing complexity of Screen Studies as a discipline requires that we rethink how it can best serve creative practitioners. Screen Studies—when designed with practitioners in mind—can serve as a site for experimentation critical for the creative development of students. \n\nScreen Studies offers students a vocabulary for analysing form and meaning while modelling ways of thinking that embrace ambiguity, risk-taking, and the reframing of norms. It can become an experimental space where students test new conceptual frames, challenge dominant canons, and engage with diverse perspectives that unsettle conventional ways of seeing and making.\n\nThis presentation shares early findings from a large-scale survey currently underway across Australian and international film schools. Drawing on our survey results and curriculum design experience, we argue for a practitioner-focused approach to Screen Studies that supports experimentation, reflective practice, and inspiration, without sacrificing intellectual rigour. Our research aims to map how Screen Studies is being taught to filmmaking students: What texts, activities, and pedagogical approaches are being used? How do programs balance conceptual knowledge with creative discovery? And to what extent do current curricula align with the needs and learning styles of practical, industry-focused students?\n\nWe hope this collaborative conversation will help identify shared challenges, successful strategies, and emerging innovations moving toward a flexible and adaptive framework for Screen Studies pedagogy that supports the next generation of creative screen practitioners.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes an experimental shift in undergraduate film studies pedagogy, using cinematic annotation as a means of cultivating students’ skills in close formal analysis. In the context of increasing reliance on generative AI—particularly in first-year student writing—this method offers a way to re-centre attention, observation, and audiovisual literacy. The approach involves a two-stage assessment structure: beginning with the use of digital video annotation tools to analyse a short film sequence, followed by a written essay that develops and extends those annotations into a formal argument.\n\nThough not yet implemented, this proposal responds to the challenges I have observed in teaching large first-year cohorts, where traditional essays are often stylistically fluent but critically superficial, and where students struggle to engage meaningfully with cinematic form. The paper situates this proposed method within the broader literature on multimodal learning, critical pedagogy, and AI-era assessment redesign. It argues that cinematic annotation offers a valuable experimental framework, one that invites students to think through images and sounds, and to reclaim interpretive agency at a time when automated fluency is easily accessible but pedagogically hollow.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the film frame as a core component of cinematic narration and visual storytelling in experimental filmmaking. Through practice-based research, it examines the role and presence the film frame serves in the production of a horror film. The analysis draws from the production of a 71-minute horror film titled Under the Red, presented from my perspective as a film director.\n\nThe research finds that the frame, as part of an aesthetic system, acts as a temporal window into a story world. Through cinematic narration, it conveys storyline, characters and settings to an audience. It can show factual events, before and after they occur. It can also embody a character’s individual perspective, showing how they interpret the world through thoughts, feelings and memory.\n\nThe research identifies four distinct frame modes: objective, subjective, omniscient, and enigmatic. The objective frame focuses on representing facts at an individual level, adopting ‘neutral’ camera positions at eye level. The subjective frame can represent an emotional or personal sense of an individual’s reality. The omniscient frame is aware of all perspectives and facts, presenting narrative information as a reliable, God-like narrator.\n\nExpanding on this, the research introduces the concept of the enigmatic frame. It is a cinematic perspective that deliberately conceals information from on-screen characters, influencing their behaviour and actions in specific ways. It is not bound by individual perspectives, nor is it interested in factual narration. Instead, it embodies a vague and mysterious force that distorts the story to suit its own agenda, as it celebrates artifice from a higher, detached perspective. The presentation will include selected scenes from Under the Red, which serve to illustrate my analytical framework and key concepts discussed.",

Since critic Roger Ebert coined the term in 1990 to describe Cinema Paradiso (1988) – now a benchmark of the form – the phrase ‘love letter to cinema’ has circulated widely in industry and audience discourse, and yet it has evaded formal academic analysis.\n\nThis paper addresses that gap through my PhD thesis, Writing a ‘Love Letter to Cinema’: A Screenwriter’s Creative Practice Approach to Investigating an Emerging Film Genre. In the spirit of methodological and creative experimentation, the research tests the possibility of codifying an emergent genre through the writing of a feature-length screenplay – one that operates simultaneously as a creative artefact and a site of theoretical engagement, in line with Batty and Kerrigan’s (2018) framing of screenwriting as scholarly enquiry.\n\nThe research is also informed by Csikszentmihalyi’s (1997) Systems Model of Creativity, which situates innovation at the intersection of individual practice, domain knowledge (genre theory), and the field (critics, scholars, educators). This is enriched by McIntyre’s (2012) work on cultural production, which challenges individualist myths of creativity by emphasising the collaborative, institutional, and structural forces shaping creative practice.\n\nWhile screenwriting aligns with Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of ‘flow’, presenting the research to an academic audience – such as ASPERA attendees – constitutes a second, equally experimental stage: the pursuit of field recognition. This dual process of creation and classification is key to how new genres gain legitimacy in cultural and scholarly contexts.\n",

          "abstract": "This paper is inspired by the philosophical component of Guy Debord’s (1958/2006) dérive (literally ‘drifting’); where “life [can] be reimagined differently from how it is currently constructed” (Lavery 2018, p. 2). It considers how the screenwriter, as researcher-practitioner, might drift through their own research journey, embracing the spontaneity of a conceptual dérive. My screenplay The Mourning Site serves as a case study for discussing craft-based methodologies that support a “discovery-driven” script development process advocated by Margot Nash (2014, p. 98): “I strongly suggest that the mysterious and often messy process where ideas need time to ferment be valued”.\nThis paper examines the use of the Enneagram personality system in character development and surrealist practices (such as automatism and collage) in crafting what Cynthia Freeland (2000, p. 256, cited in Kimber 2014, p. 59) terms “horror numbers”: sequences of spectacle, exaggerated violence, and/or monstrous behaviour. Furthermore, the screenplay applies the visual metaphor of haunting as a fluid cycle to the narrative – reimagining the three-act structure as a ‘haunting house’ (in cycles), rather than a linear template. \nNouri Gana (2013, p.83, cited in Laine 2023, p. 6) argues that “this question of whether or not trauma can be represented is a complex one, insofar as trauma simultaneously resists and demands representation”. In response, Cathy Caruth (1996, p. 50, cited in Laine 2023, p. 6) suggests that “an experience that exceeds the possibility of narrative knowledge [...] will best be represented by a failure of narrative”. By challenging conventional story structure, The Mourning Site simultaneously seeks to challenge dominant ideologies instilled within these traditions. \nThis paper discusses the challenges of experimental screencraft and how the horror screenwriter can sculpt their theoretical knowledge through the malleable expedition that is practice-based research. It is this “blending” of creative practice and theory that Tara Brabazon (2020, p. 15) describes as transformative, altering “both initiating compounds to create something different, meaningful and worthwhile”.\n\n",

          "abstract": "Downloaded files of Dan Gilroy's 2014 screenplay Nightcrawler, with its font and format variations has circulated through communities of screenwriters, screenwriting educators and practitioners as an example of how a writer-director can use the page to evoke the themes and world of its eventual form in cinema. Likewise, Bruce Robinson’s Withnail and I (1987) with its playwrighting conventions and any number of Quentin Tarantino’s self-described novelistic expressions of the films he was developing have inspired aspiring screenwriters, and screenwriting students, to test the form. Much has been written (including by me) critiquing dominant storytelling structures, but here I aim to get playful with the page itself. In this presentation, I will track the experiments I have been doing in my screenwriting practice research over my eight years in the academy, and test out some new ones to inspire conversation about the different ways in which we can push the boundaries of an historically inflexible form. In my screenplay-as-film (Not a Euphemism, presented at Sightlines 2023), I used the affordances of screenwriting software, such as voice assignation and read along options, and screen recorded the results to make a video demonstrating a queering of screenplay formatting, structure and function, paying particular attention to dialogue and transition. For my 2018 experimental screenplay Sluglines as Ghostly Presence (presented at the Scriptwriting-As-Research Symposium at USQ, and published in TEXT), the focus was on scene headings and the parenthetical elements. In this presentation, I home in on character and dialogue, borrowing strategies from phone texting, online posting and meme-making to disrupt the limited tools in conventional screenplay formatting for denoting pace and rhythm.

          "abstract": "This paper offers a provocation: what if the way we teach experimental film in Australian universities is unintentionally stifling the very innovation it seeks to inspire? As pracademics with over 40 years of combined film production and 15 years of academic experience, we contend that the standard approach to teaching experimental film encourages replication and randomness rather than true innovation.\nFirst, experimental film courses that begin with a historical survey of avant-garde movements often lead students to replicate established techniques rather than develop original responses to contemporary creative challenges. This emphasis on the past can unintentionally transform once- radical practices into formulaic academic exercises.\nSecond, students are frequently encouraged to “experiment” without clear objectives, based on the belief that open-ended exploration naturally fosters creativity. However, this approach risks confusing randomness with innovation. While accidental discoveries like penicillin or Viagra are often cited to defend unstructured experimentation, such outcomes are statistically rare— estimated at less than 0.1%. In the context of time-limited creative education, this is an inefficient and unreliable model for fostering meaningful innovation.\nWe propose a shift toward purpose-driven experimentation - a model where students identify specific aesthetic, narrative, or technical problems and use experimental strategies to address them. This approach retains the spirit of innovation while grounding it in critical inquiry and practical outcomes. It also challenges the assumption that experimental practice is incompatible with producing “job-ready” graduates.\nRather than valorising ambiguity for its own sake, we champion structured risk-taking, iterative design, and reflective creative practice. By reframing experimental film pedagogy around focused innovation rather than historical reimagination or chaotic play, we can better prepare students to contribute original, relevant work to contemporary screen culture.\nThis paper advocates for a pracademic model that balances creative freedom with critical accountability—where experimentation is not an end in itself, but a method for solving problems, provoking thought, and making meaning.\"\n\n",

          "abstract": "Research into the influence of constraints on the filmmaking process within The Shoot Out 24 Hour Filmmaking Festival uncovered insights and findings that have application within the academy’s pedagogical context. \n\nThe filmmaking challenge of the festival, with its inherent constraints, not only enabled but fuelled creativity, motivating entrants to self-impose additional parameters. The entrants were motivated to introduce novelty and disrupt the traditions of the domain while maintaining the traditions that ensured their novel variation would be accepted by the field [and judges], (street, 2023) \n\nEntrants were synergistically motivated to engage and re-engage with the festival’s creative system. They were consciously aware that they were building skills to meet the challenge, and once achieved, extend the challenge to further engage in what Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi refer to as creative flow resulted in ‘a force for expansion in relation to … growth of skills’ (2002, p. 92). The festivals ability to adapt, respond and ensure a level of creative disruption within its strict filmmaking scaffold enabled skills growth, maintained motivation, encouraged creative risk taking and avoided creative complacency and stagnation.\n\nWithin the academy where skills development is key, scoffolded learning is an accepted and proven strategy. Philipsen examines the effects of von Trier’s strict scaffolding to the filmmaking process finding ‘constraints can facilitate creativity in the film making process’ (2009, p. 1) and encourages ‘filmmakers interested in thinking outside the box to recognise that they can benefit from being placed inside the box’ (Philipsen, 2009, p. 1) or operating inside rules, structures or film manifesto movements. \n\nIn the context of the academy this research implies that rather than designing learning opportunities where the scaffolding parameters become less prescribed as skills develop, that in fact the reverse can also be beneficial, especially when learners are encouraged to impose restrictions of their own.\n",

          "abstract": "With increased competition exerting pressure on traditional opportunities for documentary production and distribution, filmmakers and producers are seeking alternative, experimental, and innovative pathways to funding, audience, and activism. In this context, the emergent role of the impact producer is influencing creative and business aspects of the production process. By understanding the complexity of the impact producer role, tensions associated with risk and uncertain outcomes are illuminated. An example is the traditional producer’s goal of financial return on investment (ROI) expressed in tangible figures such as box office ticket sales and licensing fees versus the ROI goal for the impact producer which is measurable change a documentary can generate around an injustice issue. An inherent risk presented by impact production is the challenge of predicting ROI generated by a strategic impact campaign and measurement of actual ROI as change in community affecting a specific issue. \n\nTaking a creative approach to fundraising for the production of a documentary as well as fundraising for the impact campaign involves experimenting with donor partnerships and platforms to reach audience. Such partnerships may include stakeholders who are aware of one another professionally but have not worked together on the issue they want to influence and improve. It involves devising a novel or unusual alignment of goals to affect a climate; environmental or social justice issue explored within a documentary.\n\nI argue that the need for experimentation and innovation is greater now as distribution platforms to reach audiences shift and evolve, as well as funding is a calculated risk in the risk-averse era of late-stage capitalism.\n\n",

In recent years, Flinders’ has strengthened its presence in the experimental film scene, both as a component of the Bachelor of \nCreative Arts (Screen) degree, and via the Hanlon Larsen Experimental Screen Fellowship, an arts grant administered by Flinders. By unpacking both of these activities, this presentation will give an overview of how experimental filmmaking can be embedded within undergraduate university curriculum, and developed in such a manner that will equip graduates to sustainably continue their experimental filmmaking practice. \n\nStudents enrolled in the Bachelor of Creative Arts (Screen) and Bachelor of Creative Industries (Film and Television) first encounter experimental filmmaking as a module within the first year core unit SCME1000 Film Form and Analysis, which covers major historical movements in experimental film, their stylistic dimensions, exhibition contexts, and their link to broader movements in modernist art.\n\nAt third year level, students in the Bachelor of Creative Arts (Screen) take the core unit SCME3071 Screen Production 9: Experimental Film and Music Video, in which they produce an experimental film and a music video, which is informed by experimental film practice.\n\nSince 2021, Flinders University has administered the Hanlon Larsen Screen Fellowship, named after the late Flinders Screen Production lecturer Cole Larsen, who taught experimental film. Delivered in partnership with the Adelaide Film Festival, the Mercury, and ILA, this fellowship has supported the production of new screen works including On Film (Emma Hough-Hobbs, 2022), Paco (Tim Carlier, 2023), Red Earth (Bryce Kraehenbuehl, 2023) and Strega (Tiah Trimboli, 2024). This presentation will outline the history of the screen fellowship, the works produced by successful recipients so far, and will share information on the next phase of the fellowship, positioning Flinders graduates at the forefront of a growing experimental film culture in South Australia.",

Conceived in response to a \nlack of institutional infrastructure for experimental, practice-led work in game design \nand screen media, the Lab emerged from a desire to legitimise forms of creative \nresearch that embrace failure, value iteration, and foster innovation, particularly within the context of screen production education and emerging interactive forms.\nThe paper traces the Lab’s journey from a small collective into a recognised research \ncluster. Drawing on reflective practice, it explores how the Lab was shaped by the \nneed to bridge gaps between academic inquiry and industry application, between \ndisciplines, and between emerging researchers and the structures that support them. \nThe Lab provides space for speculative design, prototype-driven projects, and socially \nresponsive screen practices that often sit outside traditional research or commercial \nmodels.\nA key milestone in this trajectory was the launch of the Experimental Game Design \nConference in 2021. Founded as an extension of the Lab’s mission, the conference \nhas become a platform for experimental, practice-led games research. While other \nevents explore games through theoretical or technical perspectives, this conference \nfocuses on practice-led experimentation as a creative methodology, supporting a \ncommunity of early researchers, students, and practitioners working at disciplinary and institutional edges.\nRather than offering a universal model, the paper presents a situated case study in \ndesigning a collaborative environment for screen-based research and education within a creative school. It reflects on the challenges and possibilities of building platforms \nthat make space for uncertainty, creative risk, and long-term collaboration. In doing so, the Experimental Games Lab is positioned as a response to a structural gap, an \necosystem that attempts to foster innovation by embracing failure and expanding the \nrole of experimental practice in screen media research.\nDr Justin Carter is a researcher, game designer and award-winning educator.

The ability to work across disciplines can contribute to learners developing understandings of how creative practice can be applied to a range of environments and purposes and better equip them for future employment in client-based projects. Peer-to-peer interdisciplinary collaborations can improve skills like communication, decision-making, and teamwork. Peer assisted learning can contribute to building self-confidence and creative capacity.\n\nFollowing a literature review on peer-to-peer collaborations between nursing and creative students, and feasibility-exploring focus groups with staff and students from both disciplines, a pilot peer-to-peer creative learning collaboration was conducted at Curtin University.  Nursing and creative arts students formed dyads to co-design artworks based on the nursing students' clinical experiences. The arts students developed creative pieces, while the nursing students engaged in a progressive critical reflection. The project culminated in a student artwork showcase and written exegesis.\n\nPreliminary results suggest this collaboration fosters engagement, reflection, and problem-solving. The approach has the potential to enhance interprofessional understanding and promote the use of creative arts for nurse well-being, with potential for integration into curricula across both disciplines and the wider university. This pilot collaboration aimed to increase students’ engagement and curiosity in their own learning preferences; and improve students’ ability to problem solve, reflect and articulate their experiences. We hoped it would enhance interprofessional understanding of the roles of other disciplines and expose creative arts students to working in health care settings and nursing students to the creative arts as a means of enhancing wellbeing.\n\nThis presentation will focus on screen works produced by student filmmakers in the pilot with attention to learner engagement, levels of innovation and experimentation. I will discuss the potential for creative media interdisciplinary collaborations to foster cultural awareness, creative competencies and encourage exploration. \n\n\n",

Each filmmaker interrogated the issue through the lens of their filmmaking practice and developed responses with the group. After this initial ideation, and over the following four years we developed different research processes and films. \n\nSiobhan and I come together in this paper/presentation to interrogate our subsequent experience of project development through experimentation, and the unorthodox unscripted films that resulted. I interrogate turning to experimentation as a response to the fraught intersection of documentary filmmaking within the ethics approval environment of the academy, substituting actors for participants and women for men, filming them in a devised workshop for the resulting documentary ‘Calm The F**K Down’. Siobhan interrogates the pivot from her original intention to re-create and film a conversation with her eldest in a shopping mall car park, to the feature documentary, A Love Poem, charting a mother’s relationship with her adult children, in particular her eldest, which she describes as a bricolage of personal archive and casual communication, gleaned from phones, hard drives, and SD cards. \n\nTogether we explore the effect of our embrace of experimentation on the creative practice-based research process. When there are no fixed ideas about realisation, or whether there will even be a completed or watchable film as a result of research, we pose the questions – is this the point of creative practice-based research in the academy, and if so, how do we bring this into our teaching practice with its industry ready focus?\n\n",

Rather than treating these shifts as obstacles, I position them as productive sites of knowledge generation, revealing aspects of documentary practice typically rendered invisible by conventional professional discourse focused on seamless execution.\nProcedural filming becomes both research method and creative practice: systematic capture strategies extending beyond conventional coverage into varied perspectives, heights, and spatial relationships. This procedural approach is designed to generate editorially coherent material while remaining open to non-narrative structural possibilities, demonstrating how a systematic methodology can support affect-driven practice rather than constrain it. Each filming session is documented through reflective voice recordings and written observations that capture the micro-negotiations between body, technology, and environment.\nThe presentation will include video excerpts from procedural filming sessions, showing how different personANDcamera configurations generate distinct forms of spatial and temporal knowledge. These clips reveal the productive insights that emerge when established filming habits evolve through deepened embodied knowledge, demonstrating how mature practice generates new creative possibilities.\nThis experimental approach contributes to discussions about vulnerable scholarship in screen studies while offering practical methodologies for practitioners investigating their own embodied relationships with technology. By positioning evolving practice as a site of knowledge rather than decline, the research challenges assumptions about expertise and mastery in documentary practice.\n\n",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates an experimental approach to narrative cinema by developing and producing The Most Dangerous, a 100-minute feature film shot over an intensive ten-day schedule. The film is a case study in embracing constraints to foster creative innovation and embodies a practice-based experiment in minimalist screen storytelling and production strategy.\n\nThe Most Dangerous explores the distressing journey of Gene, a retired police inspector in his 70s, and his emotional unravelling under the weight of grief and guilt following the gruesome death of his wife and daughter. Drawing inspiration from Eastern European art-house cinema, the film adopts a minimalist aesthetic, utilizing black-and-white visuals, prolonged takes, and sparse dialogue to mirror Gene's internal turmoil. Designed as an experiment in form and method: a conscious decision to limit cinematic tools—dialogue, coverage, colour, and camera movement—while amplifying emotional and thematic resonance through performance, sound, and uninterrupted observation.\n\nThis paper interrogates how embracing constraint as a form of experimentalism fostered creative decision-making across writing, directing, and visual design. Rather than viewing production limitations as obstacles, this methodology repositions them as frameworks for experimentation that inform aesthetic and narrative choices. The film's ten-day shoot was a logistical necessity and a conceptual challenge—a provocation to explore what kind of feature-length storytelling could emerge by embracing all these constraints.\n\nConsidering the conference themes, this work invites discussion around how experimental practices can be embedded within Australian screen production education. It advocates for a model of creative risk-taking, where filmmakers and students alike are encouraged to engage in experimental processes—not only in avant-garde terms but within the practical realities of independent filmmaking. The paper positions The Most Dangerous as a case study in screen-based experimental research: a filmmaking mode where production practice becomes a site of inquiry.\n\n",

CABAH adopted a transdisciplinary approach to support the development of cultural and scientific narratives to tell a culturally inclusive, globally significant human and environmental history of Australia. \nThis session will explore some of the significant screen-based works that emerged from the Centre and the creative, educational and social impacts of this work. It will draw on a range of methods, approaches, and contexts, however focus will be anchored by the fulldome planetarium film The Earth Above: A Deep Time View of Australia’s Epic History and experiences that emerged around this. These experiences include a significant exhibition at Queensland Museum, a national schools design challenge and international distribution of The Earth Above through planetariums and festivals. \nWe propose that co-creative screen-based practice-led research, trans-disciplinary approaches and innovative impact and engagement design strategies can open up space for agency and action across a range of settings. This occurs through:\n•\ttime and space (making this available); \n•\tpedagogical process (of learning through doing, engaging, and participating that generates conscious thought); and \n•\tcollective experimentation (social process, error/discomfort and iteration)\nThe panel format spans four (4) short presentations, discussants, as well as time for broader audience response and discussion. The purpose of the panel is to collectively extend our thinking and continue the conversation about trans-disciplinary approaches to screen-based practice-led research and pedagogical processes for interrogating ways of knowing, being and becoming. Through this we explore the tensions and synergies in this body of work, and the processes of potential transformation. \n\n",

          "abstract": "The session begins with the introduction of a collective of filmmakers, artists, researchers and boat builders from across several Australian Universities who worked with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CABAH) which ran from 2018-2025. CABAH adopted a transdisciplinary approach to support the development of cultural and scientific narratives to tell a culturally inclusive, globally significant human and environmental history of Australia. \nThis session will explore some of the significant screen-based works that emerged from the Centre and the creative, educational and social impacts of this work. It will draw on a range of methods, approaches, and contexts, however focus will be anchored by the fulldome planetarium film The Earth Above: A Deep Time View of Australia’s Epic History and experiences that emerged around this. These experiences include a significant exhibition at Queensland Museum, a national schools design challenge and international distribution of The Earth Above through planetariums and festivals. \nWe propose that co-creative screen-based practice-led research, trans-disciplinary approaches and innovative impact and engagement design strategies can open up space for agency and action across a range of settings. This occurs through:\n•\ttime and space (making this available); \n•\tpedagogical process (of learning through doing, engaging, and participating that generates conscious thought); and \n•\tcollective experimentation (social process, error/discomfort and iteration)\nThe panel format spans four (4) short presentations, discussants, as well as time for broader audience response and discussion. The purpose of the panel is to collectively extend our thinking and continue the conversation about trans-disciplinary approaches to screen-based practice-led research and pedagogical processes for interrogating ways of knowing, being and becoming. Through this we explore the tensions and synergies in this body of work, and the processes of potential transformation. \n\n",

Screen Careers are now working with ASPERA to collect similar data on where Higher Education and Vocational Education graduates find employment and how sustainable and rewarding that employment is. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the preliminary findings from the first survey of ASPERA graduates from Screen, Film, Media and Games programs across Australia and New Zealand. The key points of interest are around how long it takes to secure employment in the Screen Sector, is any further training required for employment to be sustainable, and what are the pathways for career progression. The Graduate Employment data will be compared to the results from Screen Careers data set so that ASPERA members, can be informed about how well our Degrees and Courses meet the needs of the sector.

          "abstract": "Film financing is inherently ‘risky business’ for a producer, and to build a sustainable financing path for a project, producer needs to be able to look into several avenues to finance. Especially in the first steps of financing, when producer is trying to get official film financing bodies to support the project. \n\nCrowdfunding represents a form of experimentation that challenges traditional risk assessment in film financing. \n\nThis presentation investigates the case study of the Finnish-Australian-German co-production feature film Iron Sky, which premiered in Berlin International Film Festival in 2012. The actual film production was preceded by a years-long crowdfunding campaign, and the scale of it had never been seen in Finnish, or Australian, film industry before that. The Iron Sky campaign used both crowd investment and crowdfunding, and in the end more than 1 million euros for the total of 7.5 million budget came from this campaign.\n\nThis funding community didn’t appear from nowhere, as the Iron Sky crew had started to build the community already from 1999 when they did their first self-, and crowdfunded film Star Wreck.\n\nThis presentation will use Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of Capital Conversion (Bourdieu 1993), and it analyses how Iron Sky disrupted the traditional capital accumulation, and presented a new structure : Social Capital (which is fan communities) translates to Economic Capital (Crowdfunding) which then translates to Symbolic Capital (festival recognition in Berlin). It will also present Iron Sky producers’ Digital ‘Habitus’ (Bourdieu 1993) where their comfort with online communities (since their first crowdfunded project Star Wreck), gave them different risk perceptions.\n\nCrowdfunding is challenge for a producer, and it requires a lot of market research, building up assets for crowdfunding campaign, and creating events for the community. In the case of the first Iron Sky film, the risk paid off.\n\n",

          "abstract": "As Australia’s screen industry faces mounting instability, from stalled funding and shrinking theatrical markets to increasing globalisation, resilience has become a defining challenge for the next generation of screen practitioners. But resilience cannot be taught as a soft skill or grafted on as an afterthought. It must be built into the very structure of how we educate and empower emerging makers.\n\nIn this presentation, we argue that experimentation in how students develop work for and with audiences is central to building resilient creative careers. We propose that screen education must move beyond preparing students for legacy industry pathways and instead cultivate adaptive makers capable of navigating shifting platforms, volatile markets, and evolving audience behaviours.\n\nWe advocate for a shift in curriculum that embeds experimentation as a foundational mode of practice normalising risk-taking, prototyping, and iteration with audiences as key to developing entrepreneurial thinking within student learning. This reframing positions students not just as future employees of a precarious sector, but as cultural entrepreneurs actively shaping the conditions of their own sustainability.\n\nWe ask: How can screen schools support experimentation as a mechanism for resilience without reducing it to trend-chasing or commercialism? What structural and pedagogical shifts are required to genuinely prepare students for creative futures that will be defined not by certainty, but by change? \n\nThis session offers a practical and conceptual model for building resilience into screen education through audience-led experimental practice.",
